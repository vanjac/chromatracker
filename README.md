# chromatracker

A cross-platform [music tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker) app. This is a work in progress and has gone through multiple iterations.

A description of the module format/features is on the [wiki](https://github.com/vanjac/chromatracker/wiki).

## Design influences

- [Impulse Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_Tracker): chromatracker can load IT files with a limited subset of features (mostly used for testing). Basic aspects of the module format along with features like NNAs are taken from Impulse Tracker.
- [PixiTracker](https://www.warmplace.ru/soft/pixitracker/): Like PixiTracker, chromatracker aims to have an approachable touch-friendly interface, with a simplified feature set reduced to the most essential components.
- [Aodix](https://web.archive.org/web/20070819041559/http://www.aodix.com/pageaodixv4.html): Like Aodix, chromatracker eliminates the pattern grid and allows events to be placed freely in time (with a resolution of 192 [PPQN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulses_per_quarter_note))
